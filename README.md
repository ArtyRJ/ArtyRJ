- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ArtyRJ
- Iâ€™m interested in mastering at least one programming language, and looking to better understand languages I have already worked with.
- Iâ€™m currently interested in learning python.
- Iâ€™m not quite yet looking to collaborate.
- Currently the languages I have worked with are Java, Javascript, .Net, C#, SQL, RPGLE, HTML, CSS, PHP, and XML.
